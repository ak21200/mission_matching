    Here is a summary of how many sliders you completed in Stage 2:
    <ul>
    <li>Round 1: <b>{% num_correct_s1_1 %} sliders</b></li>
    <li>Round 2: <b>{% num_correct_s1_2 %} sliders</b></li>
    <li>Round 3: <b>{% num_correct_s1_3 %} sliders</b></li>
    <li>Round 4: <b>{% num_correct_s1_4 %} sliders</b></li>
    <li>Round 5: <b>{% num_correct_s1_5 %} sliders</b></li>
    </ul>
