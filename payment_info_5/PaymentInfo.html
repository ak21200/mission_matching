        <h4>Your earnings</h4>
        <p>
            Stage 2 has been randomly chosen to determine your earnings for the session.<br>
            Your earnings from that stage were <strong>{{ player.participant.app_payoffs.stage2 }}</strong>.
        </p>

        <h4>Charitable donations</h4>
        <p>
            {{ if player.id_in_group == 1}}
            Your sliders completed in Stage 2 for <strong> {{ charity_name }}</strong> have been selected for donation.<br/>
            A corresponding donation of <strong>{{ player.participant.stage_donation.stage2 }}</strong> will therefore be made.

            <br/>


            {{else}}
            You have not been chosen for the charity donation.<br>
            ______ amount was donated to ____________ charity.

            {{endif}}
        </p>
