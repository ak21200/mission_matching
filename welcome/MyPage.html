            Welcome to todayâ€™s experiment and thank you for coming.
            This is an experiment in the economics of decision-making.
            If you follow the instructions, complete the experiment and make appropriate decisions,
            you can earn an appreciable amount of money.
            This will be paid to you in private, in cash, at the end of the session,
            before you leave the laboratory.
            </p>

            <strong>
            <p>There are 3 stages of equal duration in this experiment. <em>Each stage has 5 rounds of 90 seconds each </em> and
                the same slider task. The stages are independent of each other. You will be given further instructions
                for each stage.</p>

            <p><em>Your payment will be determined by your performance in one randomly chosen stage. </em> This will be chosen by
                the computer at the end of the experiment and you will be informed about it then.</p></strong>

            <p>It is important that you remain silent and do not look at other people's work.
            If you have any questions, or need assistance of any kind, please raise your
            hand and an experimenter will come to you.
            If you talk, laugh, exclaim out loud, etc., you will be asked to leave
            and you will not be paid.
            We expect and appreciate your cooperation.
            </p>

            <p>
            All decisions in today's experiment and any information you choose to give is
            recorded anonymously, and will only be used in the analysis of the data from this experiment.
