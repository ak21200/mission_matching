    <p>
        Today's experiment consists of a total of three (3) stages.
    </p>

    <p>
        The three stages are independent of each other.
        We will give you instructions for each stage at the start of that stage.
    </p>

    <p>
        The computer will choose one stage at random at the end of the experiment to
        determine your earnings for the experiment.
